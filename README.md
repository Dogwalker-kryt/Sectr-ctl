# Linux-Drive-Manager

A terminal-based drive management tool for Linux (Debian-based), written primarily in C++. 

This application provides a straightforward interface for managing storage devices — HDDs, SSDs, and more — directly from the command line.

## Why This Utility Exists

Performing Disk operations on Linux often requires chaining multiple commands together, like lsblk, dd and more.

A small mistake can lead to:
- Data loss
- System instability
- Irreversible changes

This tool exists to make those operations safer and reproducible.

It provides:

- Dry-run mode before execution
- Explicit command preview in the source code
- Input validation
- Safety confirmations
- Structured logging
- TUI for controlled interaction

The goal is not to replace underlying tools,
but to add a safety and orchestration layer on top of them.

## Version Control

#### Activly in Development

### CLI:

- Experimental: `v0.9.29.72`  
  _(partialy migrating to scf_str and minor UI fixed)_

### GUI (Not getting Updated anymore):

- Rust GUI: `v0.1.5-alpha` (Lists drives; not feature complete)
- C++ GUI: `v0.1.1-alpha`  
  _(GUI versions lag behind CLI/TUI)_

---

## Warning

**This tool is for advanced users only!** Formatting, encrypting, or modifying drives is inherently risky.  
- Always back up your data.
- Do not type arbitrary or dangerous input at prompts (such as `/dev/sda rm -rf`).  
- Double-check all device paths before confirming any destructive operation.

## Installation
_If during the installation somthing unexpected happens, you can ask for help by opening an issue or a discussion_
### Tech Stack / Requirements

- Linux (debian based recommended, but it should also run on other distros)
- C++17 compiler (e.g., g++) or higher
- OpenSSL dev libraries
- build-essential, smartmontools
- Python3 with os libary 

_The Requirements are only for when you manualy build the Application from scratch. If you use the build script, it will automaticly check and get the Required things_


### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dogwalker-kryt/Drive-Manager-Linux
cd Drive-Manager-Linux
```

### Step 1: Setup the Application envroment

There are 2 ways to do that:


#### Option 1: Python setup script

##### Step 1.1: Check

If you choose to use the setup script you have to do/check the following:

- Choose a path where the Dmgr should be installed in the ``` .env ``` file
- You have one of these package managers:
	- apt
   	- zypper
   	- dnf
   	- yum
   	- pacman
- You have ``` python3 ``` installed


##### Step 1.2: Run python script

If everything is checked, then run this command:

_(You may need to run it with ``` sudo ``` if the needed packages aren't installed)_
```sh
python3 setup.py
```


##### Step 1.3: Build

If everything went successfull, 
then you will be prompted if you want the script to compile the Dmgr.

If you choose ``` y ``` then you finished the installtion and the Dmgr is ready to use


#### Option 2: Manual Installtion

##### Step 2.1: Application Enviroment setup

**Create in a dir you like the following dirs**
- path/bin
- path/bin/bin
- path/bin/other_src
- path/data
- path/other


**Create data and move files**
Move the files in the right dirs: 
- config.conf -> data/
- log.dat -> data/
- .env -> data/
- *.md -> other/
- launcher/ -> bin/
- Lume/ -> bin/
- DriveMgr_CLI and GUI -> bin/other_src


### Step 2: Build the Binary

##### for C++ CLI

``` cd ``` into the ```DriveMgr_CLI``` folder, them run:
```sh
make
```
After this move the Binary into the path/bin/bin folder 


##### For the GUI version:

``` cd ``` into the ```DriveMgr_GUI``` folder, them run or the Rust version (if you have rust compiler):
```sh
cargo build
```
###### for C++ GUI:

``` cd ``` into the ```DriveMgr_GUI/C++-GTK-GUI``` folder, them run or the Rust version (if you have gtk):
```sh
make
```

## Usage

The recommended terminal hight and width are:
- hight : 40
- width : 120

when not using the min recommended hight and width, this can lead to corrupted text prints

Start by running the program (root required for some features):

**starting raw binary**
```sh
sudo ./DriveMgr        
```

**with flags**
```sh
sudo ./DriveMgr --operation-name  		
```

**through Launcher**
```sh
sudo dmgr	
```

When started, you'll see a menu, for example:

```
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
 │      DRIVE MANAGEMENT UTILITY       │
 ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
 │ 1. List Drives                      │
 │ 2. Format Drive                     │
 │ 3. Encrypt/Decrypt Drive            │
 │ ...                                 │
 │ 0. Exit                             │
 └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Navigate by using the Arrow Key's (in main menu only) to the desired action. The tool will prompt you for additional information (drive number, confirm, etc).  
For dangerous actions, an extra key (e.g., generated security key) is required as a safety confirmation.

## Tests

- This is the documentation of how to use the tests. 
- the tests are only realy for developers there, so if you dont change the code, you wont need test 


### Making your own tests, or modefying the current

When developing a new function you write the function like this:
```cpp
TestResult test_YOUR_TEST() {
	/* test code depends on the test */

	if (/* if test fail */) {
		return {"test_YOUR_TEST", false, "Describtion of what failed"} 
	}
	// if it succeeds:
	return {"test_YOUR_TEST", true, ""} 
}
```
- ```TestResult``` is the struct used to store the result of how many tests failed/succeded.
- To return proplerly do: ``` return {"test_YOUR_TEST", bool, "if fails, description"} ```.
- when returning ```true```, the test is marked as succeeded
- when returning ```false```, the test is marked as failed


### How to Read the results
```cpp
[CmdExec Tests]

[DRY-RUN] Would execute: touch /tmp/test_drivemgr_dryrun_test_file_12345


[Input Validation Tests]
[ERROR] Invalid input (src/DmgrLib.cpp:186, getInt) - Input not in allowed integer list
[ERROR] Invalid input (src/DmgrLib.cpp:196, getInt) - Conversion from string to int failed
[ERROR] Invalid input (src/DmgrLib.cpp:313, getChar) - Character not allowed
[ERROR] Invalid input (src/DmgrLib.cpp:302, getChar) - Input must be exactly one character

[Utility Tests]

======== Test Summary ========
[PASSED] 21
[FAILED] 1

[Failed Tests Details]
 ✗ test_cmdexec_stderr
   Message: stderr not captured correctly
===============================


Press '1' for returning to the main menu, '2' to exit:
```

When reading the results, it is important to only read the test summary and not the output.
The output before test summary is error messages from succede tests and junk. for example getInt/Char, if the input is off its limits, throws an error to the terminal -> this is expected!

**So to cause not any confusion, ignore the output before test summary**
